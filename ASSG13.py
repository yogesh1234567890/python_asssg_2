"""13. Write a function to write a comma-separated value (CSV) file. It
should accept a filename and a list of tuples as parameters. The
tuples should have a name, address, and age. The file should create
a header row followed by a row for each tuple. If the following list of
tuples was passed in:
[('George', '4312 Abbey Road', 22), ('John', '54 Love Ave', 21)]
it should write the following in the file:
name,address,age
George,4312 Abbey Road,22
John,54 Love Ave,21"""
